configuration:
  EnrollmentJWT:
    name: Enrollment JWT
    description: >-
      [OPTIONAL]
      The JWT (Java Web Token) is the output, in plain ASCII text, of the ZITI Controller when creating a new identity (endpoint).
      To pair this entity with a ZITI controller, create the identity, copy the JWT text from the output file, and paste it exactly into this field.
      Once successfully registered after the application is started (Check Logs), you may remove the JWT text from the field.
      You may register more than one identity (once per application startup) if desired, however, at least one identity is required to run.
      If not present, will not attempt any enrollment proceedures during startup.
  IdentityDirectory:
    name: Identity Directory
    description: >-
      [OPTIONAL]
      The directory that is used to place and refer to identities that have been created through the enrollment process.
      You normally should not have to modify this.
      If not present, will default to (/opt/NetFoundry/identities).
  LogLevel:
    name: Log Level
    description: >-
      [OPTIONAL]
      A numeric value between (1/INFO/LOWEST) and (6/DEBUG/HIGHEST).
      If not present, will default to (3).
  UpstreamResolver:
    name: Upstream Resolver
    description: >-
      [OPTIONAL]
      Informs the ZITI EDGE TUNNEL runtime to utilize a specific IP as the resolver for any queries that it cannot natively resolve.
      If not present, will use the default of the system from DHCP or static assignment or fallback to (1.1.1.1).
  ResolutionRange:
    name: Resolution Range
    description: >-
      [OPTIONAL]
      Informs the ZITI EDGE TUNNEL runtime that it should utilize a specific range of IPs for internal redirection of assigned services.
      If not present, will default to (100.64.64.0/18).
