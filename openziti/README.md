# Home Assistant Add-on: NetFoundry OpenZITI

![Supports aarch64 Architecture][aarch64-shield]

## What is NetFoundry OpenZITI?

This add-on adds the following functionality to your Home Assistant:

- An ultra secure and smart overlay which can be accessed by this endpoint.
- Upon service assignment, this endpoint can reach private resources or permit access to its own private resources as deemed in the CloudZITI NetFoundry Console (or OpenZITI open source variant.)
- This is useful for allowing your Home Assistant to reach and extend access to non-local resources (perhaps geographically or in different VLANs).

For more information, see the open source project page at [OpenZITI](https://github.com/openziti).
